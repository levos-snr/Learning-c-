# Create and run simple C# console applications (Get started with C#, Part 2) 

Your goal was to install and configure a development environment that meets your coding requirements for C#.

You've installed Visual Studio Code and a tour of the user interface demonstrated a logical layout that is consistent with industry standards. You were able to configure extensions that make Visual Studio Code an even more powerful tool for C# code development. You also installed the .NET SDK to provide compiler and runtime support, and support for .NET command line interface commands.
